    The Augurisk Air Pollution hazard score is defined at the U.S. block level. It is based on the daily median and maximal air quality values recorded at the nearest U.S. EPA AQI monitor over the last 3 years. All values are normalized to a 0-100 scale. To avoid disturbances in the distribution of risk scores, specific transformations to the higher percentiles of selected variables (i.e. winsorization) were applied to the maximal recorded AQI variable. <br><br>Augurisk Now shows a threat whenever the score is higher than 70.
