    The Wildfire score is based on the potential for wildfire burning in your block and the impact of climate change on the potential for wildfire in the United States, particularly in the West (Abatzoglu and Williams, 2016). Therefore, the average temperature change in summer between the 1980-2005 and 2006-2100, extracted from two selected Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the NA-CORDEX project (Mearns et al.,2017), are taken into account in defining the hazard score. The scenario considered is RCP4.5. All index values are normalized to a 0-100 scale.
    <br><br>Augurisk Now shows a threat whenever the score is higher than 70.
