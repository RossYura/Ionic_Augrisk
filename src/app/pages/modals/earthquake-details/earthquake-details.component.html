    The Earthquake Hazard index is defined at the U.S. Census block level. It is based on the intensity of the earthquake happening in your block with a 2% probability over the next 50 years, and computed using data from USGS (Rukstales and Petersen, 2019). Intensity is defined based on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale (MMI). All scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale.
     <br><br>Augurisk Now shows a threat whenever the score is higher than 70.
