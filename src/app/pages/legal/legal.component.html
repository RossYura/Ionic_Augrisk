        </ion-text>
        <ion-text>
          <p>5.1 Service Fees. With respect to the paid Services, the Client User will be charged the fees set
            forth in the relevant section on the Augurisk Site located at our pricing page or as otherwise
            offered on the Site for a particular payment or subscription plan (the "Fees"). The Fees, unless
            explicitly shown during the process of purchasing a subscription plan and following confirmation
            thereof, are exclusive of value added tax and any additional or other taxes, charges or duties which
            may be imposed with any and all payments made or due and shall, if applicable, be borne,
            respectively registered and duly declared by Client User.<br>
            5.2 Change in Fees. We may change the Fees and/or introduce new charges in addition to the Fees in
            our sole discretion upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the User. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, we may increase the Fees, immediately and with contemporaneous notice, in the event of
            (a) any change in the services or fees of our third party service providers; (b) changes in the
            Services which are made at your request; or (c) delays and/or other issues due to Client User
            failure to fulfill Client User obligations or due to Client User request to delay work for any
            reason; or (d) in the event of a change in our pricing structure. <br>
            5.3. Payment. Any Fees shall be prepaid one month, one year or two years in advance, or as otherwise
            offered on the Site for a particular subscription plan, at the option of the Client User by credit
            card or another payment method accepted on the Website. All prepaid amounts and Service plans will
            be reflected in the Client User account. Any bank fees and charges shall be borne solely by Client
            User. When opting for a subscription, the Client will be billed every month by our payment
            processor, until the Client cancels his subscription on the Subscription page.<br>
            5.4 Credits. Any credits due to a Client User will be applied on the next invoice against amounts
            then due. If there are no future invoices expected, Augurisk will issue a payment to Client User for
            credits due.<br>
            5.5 Promotional Giveaways. Occasionally we may offer promotional giveaways of the Services, subject
            to the rules that are announced at the time of any such promotional event. Client Users shall bear
            sole responsibility for any and all income tax consequences that may result from their winning any
            such giveaway. Furthermore, if required by applicable laws, Client User agrees to submit to us duly
            completed tax forms, to enable us to make all required filings with tax authorities.<br>
            5.6 Refund policy. Our paid Services are provided on a prepaid basis. Client Users may discontinue
            their use of any Services at any time in accordance with the instructions posted on the Site. The
            date and time of any cancelation of paid Services shall be the date and time on which the Client
            User completes the full cancelation process, or sends a cancellation request to our team by email.
            We do not provide refunds for used or remaining credits.<br>
            5.7 Abusive and/or repeated registrations or/and subscriptions for paid Services and cancellations,
            followed by requests for refunds, by a Client User may, in our sole discretion, be deemed to be in
            bad faith, and we reserve the right to withhold Service to any such offending Client User and refuse
            any refund otherwise available to such Client User.<br>
